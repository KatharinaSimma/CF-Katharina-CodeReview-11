Good to know:

- I added a filter function to my query on the index page instead of creating new pages where I just copy and paste and change the query. I felt this would just be wasted time and I took the time instead to find out how to set a filter to a query. 

- If you enter a new pet, and don't add an image link, a default image will appear (blue jelly fish). Check out the comments in  actions/a_create.php to see how it works. You can enter any image you like, however the bootstrap is written for 1920x1280. Other pictures may have an effect on the appearance.
