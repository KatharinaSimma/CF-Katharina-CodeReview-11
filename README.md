# CF-Katharina-CodeReview-11

## Good to know:

* I added a **filter functionality** to my query on the index page instead of creating new pages where I just copy and paste and change the query. I felt this would just be wasted time and I took the time instead to find out how to set a filter to a query. Please give me feedback if that is good practice. 

* If you enter a new pet, and don't add an image link, a **default image** will appear (blue jelly fish). Check out the comments in  actions/a_create.php to see how it works. You can enter any image you like, however the bootstrap is written for 1920x1280. Other pictures may have an effect on the appearance. Let me know if this is a good way to solve this. I feel like we should know more about input validation (which we only learned to copy and paste from the pre-work). There should be a whole day on input validation! It is not only important but dangerous to create vulnerable databases!

## Open Tasks:
* Some action pages have bootstrap not included
* The Task did not state to create a functionality to actually adopt a pet. I included it in my setup but I haven't implemented it yet.
* Bonus points
