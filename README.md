Good to know:
- If you enter a new pet, and don't add an image link, a default image will appear (blue jelly fish). Check out the comments in  actions/a_create.php to see how it works. You can enter any image you like, however the bootstrap is written for 1920x1280. Other pictures may have an effect on the appearance.
